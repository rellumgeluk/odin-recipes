Greetings
This is my first HTML project and the my objective is to put in practice what I've learned by now.
In advance I must say this project may not be aesthetic pleasant but as soon as I learn about CSS I will come back to it.

In this project I will build some HTML chops; consisting in a main index page with links to a few recipes.
Thanks for reading, 
Have a good one!
